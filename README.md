# Demos & Chill

Demos & Chill is a small event series in San Francisco put on by a group of friends, once-a-month-or-two-ish, where people interested in doing creative things with technology show off cool stuff they've made.

Designers, engineers, makers of all stripes welcome! The idea is to keep the scope of these meetups relatively open as a lot of the most interesting things are at the boundary of disciplines.
